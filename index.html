                     <p>
                        I transitioned Epic's Dutch billing data conversion from an error-prone, Epic owned process to a completely customer-run utility menu.
                        This allows organizations to be self-sufficient when converting their legacy data into Epic for the first time, 
						and lets Epic technical support prioritize investigating technical errors. 
                        We estimate this new utility allows organizations to save an estimated $16,500 on their install budgets. 
                        The utility can also be used to move data from one Epic service area to another, 
						allowing organizations to properly bill from the correct source in Epic without sacrificing a seamless clinician experience.

                        The patient invoices previously available to Dutch organizations were plain text and not visually appealing. 
                        After researching which data elements were required by Dutch regulatory bodies to be present on an invoice, 
                        I designed and developed rich text invoices for the Dutch community. The new format is easier to setup and maintain 
                        and the condensed format requires less paper, allowing organizations to save money on printing costs. 
                        Easier to understand visuals also reduce patient calls to hospital billing staff and increase satisfaction for institutions billed using the new format.

                     <p>
                        The CCI Program was originally released by the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). 
                        It was therefore impossible to use these checks on patients not covered by insurance or in international locales. 
                        I expanded the available use cases for these checks so organizations can hold their documentation on all patients to the same standards as those covered by Medicare or Medicaid.
